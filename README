Install dependencies (the name will change between distros):

    - build-essentials, base-devel or similar
    - libqt4-dev
    - kdelibs5-dev
    - libplasma3

For archlinux following packages are needed:
    - qt4
    - kdebase-workspace
    - automoc4
    - cmake

To build:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. && make

To install:

    $ sudo make install

To test:

    $ kbuildsycoca4
    $ plasmoidviewer takeoff

Improvements:

    - hitting ESC in menu tab wish hide the applet
    - tabs can be changed using CTRL+TAB(forward) and CTRL+SHIFT+TAB(backward)
    - you can navigate between items in menu tab and in search tab using arrow
      keys. The focused item will be higlighted

TODO:
    - you cannot switch between numbered tabs of the same category
    - when switching tabs the focused item is remembered(it should lose focus)
